# azurerm_databricks_workspace

Manages a Databricks Workspace

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_databricks_workspace" "example" {
  name                = "databricks-test"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  sku                 = "standard"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Databricks Workspace resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group in which the Databricks Workspace should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource has to be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sku` - (Required) The `sku` to use for the Databricks Workspace. Possible values are `standard`, `premium`, or `trial`. Changing this can force a new resource to be created in some circumstances.

~> **NOTE** Downgrading to a `trial sku` from a `standard` or `premium sku` will force a new resource to be created.

* `managed_resource_group_name` - (Optional) The name of the resource group where Azure should place the managed Databricks resources. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE** Azure requires that this Resource Group does not exist in this Subscription (and that the Azure API creates it) - otherwise the deployment will fail.

* `customer_managed_key_enabled` - (Optional) Is the workspace enabled for customer managed key encryption? If `true` this enables the Managed Identity for the managed storage account. Possible values are `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. This field is only valid if the Databricks Workspace `sku` is set to `premium`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `infrastructure_encryption_enabled`- (Optional) Is the Databricks File System root file system enabled with a secondary layer of encryption with platform managed keys? Possible values are `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. This field is only valid if the Databricks Workspace `sku` is set to `premium`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - (Optional) Allow public access for accessing workspace. Set value to `false` to access workspace only via private link endpoint. Possible values include `true` or `false`. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `require_network_security_group_rules` - (Optional) Does the data plane (clusters) to control plane communication happen over private link endpoint only or publicly? Possible values `AllRules`, `NoAzureDatabricksRules` or `NoAzureServiceRules`. Required when `public_network_access_enabled` is set to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `custom_parameters` - (Optional) A `custom_parameters` block as documented below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

A `custom_parameters` block supports the following:

* `aml_workspace_id` - (Optional) The ID of a Azure Machine Learning workspace to link with Databricks workspace. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `load_balancer_backend_pool_name` - (Optional) Name of the outbound Load Balancer Backend Pool for Secure Cluster Connectivity (No Public IP). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `load_balancer_id` - (Optional) Resource URI of Outbound Load balancer for Secure Cluster Connectivity (No Public IP) workspace. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `nat_gateway_name` - (Optional) Name of the NAT gateway for Secure Cluster Connectivity (No Public IP) workspace subnets. Defaults to `nat-gateway`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `public_ip_name` - (Optional) Name of the Public IP for No Public IP workspace with managed vNet. Defaults to `nat-gw-public-ip`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `no_public_ip` - (Optional) Are public IP Addresses not allowed? Possible values are `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `public_subnet_name` - (Optional) The name of the Public Subnet within the Virtual Network. Required if `virtual_network_id` is set. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `public_subnet_network_security_group_association_id` - (Optional) The resource ID of the `azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association` resource which is referred to by the `public_subnet_name` field. Required if `virtual_network_id` is set.

* `private_subnet_name` - (Optional) The name of the Private Subnet within the Virtual Network. Required if `virtual_network_id` is set. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `private_subnet_network_security_group_association_id` - (Optional) The resource ID of the `azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association` resource which is referred to by the `private_subnet_name` field. Required if `virtual_network_id` is set.

* `storage_account_name` - (Optional) Default Databricks File Storage account name. Defaults to a randomized name(e.g. `dbstoragel6mfeghoe5kxu`). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `storage_account_sku_name` - (Optional) Storage account SKU name. Possible values inclued`Standard_LRS`, `Standard_GRS`, `Standard_RAGRS`, `Standard_GZRS`, `Standard_RAGZRS`, `Standard_ZRS`, `Premium_LRS` or `Premium_ZRS`. Defaults to `Standard_GRS`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `virtual_network_id` - (Optional) The ID of a Virtual Network where this Databricks Cluster should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `vnet_address_prefix` - (Optional) Address prefix for Managed virtual network. Defaults to `10.139`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE** Databricks requires that a network security group is associated with the `public` and `private` subnets when a `virtual_network_id` has been defined. Both `public` and `private` subnets must be delegated to `Microsoft.Databricks/workspaces`. For more information about subnet delegation see the [product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview).

## Import

Databrick Workspaces can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_databricks_workspace.workspace1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Databricks/workspaces/workspace1
