# azurerm_container_registry

Manages an Azure Container Registry.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the access key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_container_registry" "acr" {
  name                     = "containerRegistry1"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  sku                      = "Premium"
  admin_enabled            = false
  georeplication_locations = ["East US", "West Europe"]
}
```

## Example Usage (Encryption)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_container_registry" "acr" {
  name                = "containerRegistry1"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  sku                 = "Premium"

  identity {
    type = "UserAssigned"
    identity_ids = [
      azurerm_user_assigned_identity.example.id
    ]
  }

  encryption {
    enabled            = true
    key_vault_key_id   = data.azurerm_key_vault_key.example.id
    identity_client_id = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.example.client_id
  }

}

resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "example" {
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  name = "registry-uai"
}

data "azurerm_key_vault_key" "example" {
  name         = "super-secret"
  key_vault_id = data.azurerm_key_vault.existing.id
}



```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Container Registry. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Container Registry. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `admin_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether the admin user is enabled. Defaults to `false`.

* `storage_account_id` - (Required for `Classic` Sku - Forbidden otherwise) The ID of a Storage Account which must be located in the same Azure Region as the Container Registry.  Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sku` - (Optional) The SKU name of the container registry. Possible values are  `Basic`, `Standard` and `Premium`. `Classic` (which was previously `Basic`) is supported only for existing resources.

~> **NOTE:** The `Classic` SKU is Deprecated and will no longer be available for new resources from the end of March 2019.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

* `georeplication_locations` - (Optional / **Deprecated in favor of `georeplications`**) A list of Azure locations where the container registry should be geo-replicated.

~> **NOTE:** The `georeplication_locations` is only supported on new resources with the `Premium` SKU.

~> **NOTE:** The `georeplication_locations` list cannot contain the location where the Container Registry exists.

~> **NOTE:** The `georeplication_locations` is deprecated, use `georeplications` instead.

* `georeplications` - (Optional) A `georeplications` block as documented below.

~> **NOTE:** The `georeplications` is only supported on new resources with the `Premium` SKU.

~> **NOTE:** The `georeplications` list cannot contain the location where the Container Registry exists.

* `network_rule_set` - (Optional) A `network_rule_set` block as documented below.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - (Optional) Whether public network access is allowed for the container registry. Defaults to `true`.

* `quarantine_policy_enabled` - (Optional) Boolean value that indicates whether quarantine policy is enabled. Defaults to `false`.

* `retention_policy` - (Optional) A `retention_policy` block as documented below.

* `trust_policy` - (Optional) A `trust_policy` block as documented below.

* `zone_redundancy_enabled` - (Optional) Whether zone redundancy is enabled for this Container Registry? Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Defaults to `false`.

  ~> **NOTE:** `quarantine_policy_enabled`, `retention_policy`, `trust_policy` and `zone_redundancy_enabled` are only supported on resources with the `Premium` SKU.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as documented below.

* `encryption` - (Optional) An `encryption` block as documented below.

---

`georeplications` supports the following:

* `location` - (Required) A location where the container registry should be geo-replicated.

* `zone_redundancy_enabled` - (Optional) Whether zone redundancy is enabled for this replication location? Defaults to `false`.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to this replication location.

---

`network_rule_set` supports the following:

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

## Import

Container Registries can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_container_registry.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourcegroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/myregistry1
```
